Modern CSS has evolved significantly, offering powerful features for creating sophisticated layouts and interactions. Let's explore some advanced techniques.

## CSS Grid and Flexbox

Understanding the power of modern layout systems and when to use each one. Grid for 2D layouts, Flexbox for 1D layouts.

## CSS Custom Properties

Variables in CSS have revolutionized how we manage design tokens and create dynamic themes.

```css
:root {
  --primary-color: #0066ff;
  --spacing-unit: 1rem;
}
```

## Modern Selectors

New selectors like `:has()`, `:where()`, and `:is()` provide unprecedented control over styling.
